# malware-url-checker-api

This project uses serverless framework. Two lambdas written in Python are

1) malwarechecker: Integreated with AWS API gateway and Dynamo Db meant to take GET request in the below format and query dynamo DB to find if URL is safe to use.

        Request Format
        https://ul521ol910.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/urlinfo/1/google.com

        Response Format
        {
        "URL requested": "google.com",
        "isURLSafe": "YES"
        }

        {
        "URL requested": "abcd.com",
        "isURLSafe": "NO"
        }

2) feedupdate: Receives real time notification from S3 when new malware url feed is uploaded. This lambda will accept coma seperated csv file and feed a Dynamo DM table which malwarechecker uses.
